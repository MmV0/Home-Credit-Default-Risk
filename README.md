# Home-Credit-Default-Risk
This project aims to predict the likelihood of default for loan applicants at Home Credit, a financial institution focused on providing loans to underserved populations with little or no credit history.

To accomplish this task, we will be using a dataset provided by Home Credit containing a variety of information on loan applicants, including demographic and financial characteristics, as well as past payment history. We will use this data to train and evaluate a variety of machine learning models in order to identify the most accurate and reliable method for predicting default risk.

The goal of this project is to help Home Credit make informed lending decisions, enabling them to provide loans to those who are most likely to successfully repay them, while also protecting the company's financial stability. By accurately predicting default risk, Home Credit can make more informed and effective lending decisions, ultimately helping to build a more sustainable and successful business.
